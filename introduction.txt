My name is Ghaith Al Ramahi, and I am a sophomore studying data science. I am originally from the United Arab Emirates, and I love all marine activities(fishing, diving, snorkeling, and sailing) as well as sports like football and golf. My favorite class so far at Boston University was Philosophy and Film, it wasfun to watch movies as homework for a semsester and it introduced me to movies I wouldnt have typically watched otherwise.
